# Vehicle-Rental-System
C++ Vehicle Rental System

Abstract:

We’re aiming through this project to build a system that could help the concerned party to help its
users to rent a vary types of vehicles in an easy and flexible way, by taking into consideration to
save the users time and effort.
In this project, there are many properties to be included such as, admin panel where admins are
able to add new vehicles or remove vehicles, which make the system able to be improved easily.
Beside of that, we include two ways for paying methods, which are direct/monthly paid, and users
have the flexibility to choose one of them. By take into consider that a little tax will be applied in
the monthly paid case. Additionally, we include a discount for the system users, and give the user
the chance to reset her/his password in case the user forget it.
The list of provided vehicles include the cars/motorcycle features such as , maximum speed,
color, and model, which make the user fully aware for any vehicles type that he/she looking to
rent. When the person register for our system, we order from the users to add their balance to
show the system and their balance, and then they will be able to determine if they are sure to
keep forward for the chosen vehicle type.

Widely, the vehicles renting is needed where all of people are looking for the most fast and easiest
way to rent, especially when they travel abroad. And since many of the vehicles renting offices
around the world are taking high prices from people if they didn’t rent before a week for instance,
this will cause them to pay the double amount of money. Besides, business are making online
sites which will be more suitable and flexible in the internet usage era. Through that, all the people
will be able approach the system, and there will be no need to search for new renting offices’
locations that is consuming time and money. Our system is presenting a site that can be provided
in any place and time, since it’s an automatically renting system. So, this system that we build will
help in providing an online system that can be used widely, and it will be available for all people
to use in any place.

The written code provides a system that will save people time, since it’s provide vary vehicles
types (of Cars & Motorcycles), and all of them will be shown along with their features such as their
color, speed, fuel type … etc. In addition to that, in case that users are not able to pay the renting
price as full amount, there will be an ability to pay as installments. By the second pay choice, the
users can select the number of months that they think they can pay the rent during it. Then, the
system will show the users the amount of money that they have to pay monthly. Additionally, this
system is easy to improve since we add the admin panel feature which help the admins to add
new cars/motorcycles easily, especially if there is any special willing from the users. The system
already provides many vehicles models. For instance, the system provides the following models
for cars: Classic, sport, 4x4. So that will give the users the opportunity to choose between them
based on their willing. Additionally, this system will apply a randomly discount service for the
system users up to 5%, and that will give a high opportunity to attract many new users to use the
system. In addition to the mentioned features above, the renting vehicle by user will not be
available to be rented for the next user.

For this system, there are no specific users since the renting vehicles service is a service provided
for all types of people that they are looking forward to rent cars/motorcycles. So, this system is
considered as a community service. The complete picture of the functionality offered by the
system is shown below in the functional system design figure.
